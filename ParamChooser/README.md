# Param chooser example: #

Example project for modifying OpenCV and camera parameters over NetworkTables.

This project allows you to change your camera parameters and vision parameters 
while running your code, which makes it easier to fiddle until you have the 
right settings. Example use cases include finding correct exposure and 
brightness settings for your camera to isolate the target effectively, and 
choosing good HSV thresholds to make sure you isolate the target under a 
variety of angles and lighting conditions.
